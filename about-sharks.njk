They are fast-swimming, agile predators. An aggressive demeanor enables them to dominate many other shark species on the reef, despite their size. They gather in groups of up to 20. They were the first shark species known to perform a threat display, a behavior warning that it is prepared to attack.</p>

Found in tropical and temperate waters, especially in central Pacific islands. Name derives from the dark stripes down its body resembling a tiger's pattern. Solitary, mostly nocturnal hunter, the Tiger shark is an apex predator having a reputation for eating anything including other sharks and injured whales.</p>
                    <p>Often found close to the coast in tropical and subtropical waters throughout the world, its behavior is primarily nomadic, but is guided by warmer currents, it stays closer to the equator throughout colder months. Recorded at depths from 10 ft to 3,000 ft. Females mate once every 3 years birthing 10-80 pups. Attacks by tiger sharks in Hawaiian waters have been shown to increase between September and November, when tiger shark females are believed to migrate to give birth.</p>

                    <p>The scalloped hammerhead is a species of hammerhead shark in the family Sphyrnidae. It was originally known as Zygaena lewini. The Greek word sphyrna translates into "hammer" in English, referring to the shape of this shark's head, which is its most distinguishing characteristic.</p>
                    <p>The shark's eyes and nostrils are at the tips of the extensions. It is a fairly large hammerhead, but is still smaller than both the great and smooth hammerheads.</p>

                    <p>The smooth hammerhead is a species of hammerhead shark in the family Sphyrnidae. It was originally known as Zygaena lewini. This species is named "smooth hammerhead" because of the distinctive shape of the head, which is flattened and laterally extended into a hammer shape (called the "cephalofoil"), without an indentation in the middle of the front margin (hence "smooth").</p>
                    <p>Unlike other hammerheads, this species prefers temperate waters and occurs worldwide at medium latitudes. In the summer, these sharks migrate towards the poles following cool water masses, sometimes forming schools numbering in the hundreds to thousands.</p>

It is distinguishable by its very high first dorsal fin and interdorsal ridge. It is not to be confused with the similarly named sand tiger shark, or Carcharias taurus.</p>
                    <p>In spite of their large size and similar appearance to other dangerous sharks such as bull sharks, Sandbars are not considered to be dangerous to people. Very few, if any attacks are attributed to sandbar sharks. As a result, they are considered one of the safest sharks to swim with and are popular sharks for aquaria.</p>
