They are highly efficient in the air, using dynamic soaring and slope soaring to cover great distances with little exertion. They feed on squid, fish, and krill by either scavenging, surface seizing, or diving.</p>
                    <p>The wingspans of the largest great albatrosses are the largest of any bird, exceeding 11.2 ft (3.40 m). Of the 22 species of albatrosses recognised by the IUCN, 21 are listed as at some level of concern; two species are critically endangered, seven species are endangered, six species are near threatened, and six species are vulnerable.</p>

                    <p>Their diet consists mostly of krill and small fish, and they use bubbles to catch prey. They are promiscuous breeders, with both sexes having multiple partners. Orcas are the main natural predators of humpback whales.</p>
                    <p>Adults range in length from 46-56 ft (14-17 m) and weigh up to 40 metric tons. The humpback has a distinctive body shape, with long pectoral fins and a knobbly head. It is known for breaching and other distinctive surface behaviors, making it popular with whale watchers. Males produce a complex song typically lasting 4 to 33 minutes.</p>

It ranges throughout the tropical Pacific and Indian Oceans and breeds on islands off Japan, on the Islas Revillagigedo, the Hawaiian Islands, the Seychelles, the Northern Mariana Islands, and off Eastern and Western Australia.</p>
                    <p>edge-tailed shearwaters are monogamous, forming a pair bond that lasts for several years. Both sexes undertake a prelaying exodus to build up energy reserves; this usually lasts around 28 days. A single egg is laid, if that egg is lost, then the pair will not attempt another that season.</p>

They have a complex nervous system and excellent sight, and are among the most intelligent and behaviourally diverse of all invertebrates.</p>
                    <p>Maze and problem-solving experiments have shown evidence of a memory system that can store both short- and long-term memory. Young octopuses learn nothing from their parents, as adults provide no parental care beyond tending to their eggs until the young octopuses hatch.</p>
